                <h3>User Friendly</h3>
                <p>
                  The goCPT app offers a user-friendly feature for determining
                  CPT codes based on time alone. To utilize this functionality,
                  simply navigate to the designated time button within the app
                  and input the total time spent managing the patient during the
                  encounter. The app will then generate the appropriate CPT
                  code, considering the significant role of time in certain
                  scenarios, such as counseling or coordination of care, in
                  determining the level of service provided

                  (straightforward/minimal, low, moderate, and high) based on a
                  meticulous assessment of Medical Decision-Making (MDM), taking
                  into account the number of diagnoses, management options, risk
                  of complications or morbidity, and the amount and complexity

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p className="para">
            GoCPT was conceived by a passionate psychiatric nurse practitioner
            who, as a new graduate, felt overwhelmed by the complexities of CPT
            coding. Faced with the daunting task of mastering medical coding
            while juggling the demands of patient care, it became clear that a
            solution was needed to bridge the gap between clinical expertise and
            administrative challenges. Time constraints and the intricate
            <br /> nature of CPT coding posed significant hurdles for healthcare
            providers
            <br /> looking to venture into private practice. Recognizing that
            coding
            <br /> and billing are formidable obstacles standing in the way
            <br /> of many talented providers, the idea
            <br /> for goCPT was born.

              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
              <p>
                At goCPT, our mission is simple yet profound - to empower mental
                health professionals and remove the barriers that hinder them
                from providing quality care and pursuing their dreams of private
                practice. We believe that every individual should have access to
                exceptional mental health care, and that starts with simplifying
                the coding and billing process.

                We envision a future where mental health care is more
                accessible, where providers can focus on what they do best -
                helping individuals on their path to wellness. By harnessing the
                power of technology, we aim to streamline the complexities of
                CPT coding, enabling providers to dedicate more time to patient
                care and less to administrative burdens.
